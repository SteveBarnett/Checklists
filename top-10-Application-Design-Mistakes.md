# Top 10 Application-Design Mistakes

## 1. Poor Feedback

Provide clear feedback:

- Show users the system's current state.
- Tell users how their commands and actions have been interpreted.
- Tell users what's happening.

### 1.a. Out to Lunch Without a Progress Indicator

1. If you can, make it less than 2 seconds.
2. If it takes 2 - 10 seconds, show a loading spinner.
3. If it takes more than 10 seconds, show a progress bar.

## 2. Inconsistency

Differences are difficult. Human minds crave consistency.

A few common types of inconsistency:

- Different words for the similar (or the same) things.
- Different places or different spacing for similar (or the same) things.
- Similar controls or similar workflow patterns that live in different places in the UI.
- Inconsistent rules for valid input data (without any feedback as to why).
- Inconsistent availability of a thing (without feedback as to why).

## 3. Bad Error Messages

The most common problem is an error message that doesn't say why something went wrong and how to fix it.

## 4. No Default Values

Defaults can:

- speed things up.
- teach by example.
- direct novice users toward a safe or common outcome.

## 5. Unlabeled icons

Pairing icons with a text label has four benefits:

- Increases the size of the target.
- Decreases time to recognise the command, helps users learn the interface.
- Help users visually differentiate between commands.

## 6. Hard-to-Acquire Targets

### 6a. Weak Signifiers

"Affordance" means what you can do to an object. Signifiers are the visual elements that help you to understand the affordances just by looking at the object.

## 6b. Tiny Click Targets

So small that users miss and click outside the active area.

## 7. Overuse of Modals

This design choice reduces context for users by covering up information that they may wish to refer to.

## 8. Meaningless Information

Long strings of letters and digits (such as GUIDs) are completely meaningless to users, but they are often prominently displayed.

## 9. Junk-Drawer Menus

Common things are shown in a nav, then "More" or "..." has everything else. This limits discoverability and findability.

## 10. Proximity of Destructive and Confirmation Actions

Makes it easy to click the wrong button or icon â€” especially when users are rushing, completing repetitive actions, or have motor difficulties.
