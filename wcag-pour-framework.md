# WCAG POUR framework

## Perceivable

Information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways they can see or hear.

- Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
- Provide alternatives for time-based media.
- Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.
- Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.


## Operable

User interface components and navigation must be designed so that users can interact with them and they can support assistive technologies such as screen readers.

- Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
- Provide users enough time to read and use content.
- Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.
- Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.


## Understandable

Information and the operation of user interface must communicate clearly and consistently so that the content is readable.

- Make text content readable and understandable.
- Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

## Robust

Content must be written so that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

- Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.
